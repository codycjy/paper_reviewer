## Abstract

We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on Rd. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of Ω(log log d) hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of d numbers.

Additionally, we provide a combinatorial proof that neural networks satisfying this assumption require three hidden layers to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.

## 1 Introduction

Among the various types of neural networks, ReLU networks have become particularly prominent [Glorot et al., 2011, Goodfellow et al., 2016]. For a thorough theoretical understanding of such neural networks, it is important to analyze which classes of functions we can represent with which depth. Classical universal approximation theorems [Cybenko, 1989, Hornik, 1991] ensure that just one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on a bounded domain with arbitrary precision.

However, establishing an analogous result for *exact* representations remains an open question and is the subject of ongoing research [Arora et al., 2018, Hertrich et al., 2023, Haase et al., 2023, Valerdi, 2024, Averkov et al., 2025]. While in practical settings approximate representations are often sufficient, studying the exact piecewise linear structure of neural network representations enabled deep connections between neural networks and fields like tropical and polyhedral geometry [Huchette et al., 2023]. These connections, in turn, are important for algorithmic tasks like neural network training [Arora et al., 2018, Goel et al.,
2021, Khalife and Basu, 2022, Froese et al., 2022, Froese and Hertrich, 2023, Bertschinger et al., 2023] and verification [Li et al., 2019, Katz et al., 2017, Froese et al., 2025b,a, Stargalla et al., 2025], including understanding the computational complexity of the respective tasks. Arora et al. [2018] initiate the study of exact representations by showing that the class of functions exactly representable by ReLU networks is the class of continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions.

Specifically, they demonstrate that every CPWL function defined on Rd can be represented by a ReLU network with ⌈log2(d + 1)⌉ hidden layers. This result is based on Wang and Sun [2005],
who reduce the representation of a general CPWL function to the representation of maxima of d + 1 affine terms. By computing pairwise maxima in each layer, such a maximum of d + 1 terms can be computed with logarithmic depth overall in the manner of a binary tree. Very recently, Bakaev et al. [2025b] improved the upper bound by proving that every CPWL function can be represented with
⌈log3(d − 1)⌉ + 1 hidden layers. Their results refute the conjecture of Hertrich et al. [2023] that ⌈log2(d + 1)⌉ hidden layers are indeed necessary to compute all CPWL functions.

Based on the result by Wang and Sun [2005], Hertrich et al. [2023] deduced that it suffices to determine the minimum depth representation of the maximum function. While it is easy to show that max0, x1, x2 cannot be represented with one hidden layer [Mukherjee and Basu, 2017], Bakaev et al. [2025b] showed that two hidden layers are sufficient to represent max0, x1, x2, x3, x4.

However, it remains open if there exists a CPWL function on Rd that really needs logarithmic many hidden layers to be represented. In particular, it is already open whether there is a function that needs more than two hidden layers to be represented. Understanding depth lower bounds is important for clarifying the potential advantages of architectural choices. In particular, proving depth lower bounds on computing the max function helps formally explain why elements like max-pooling layers are powerful and cannot be easily replaced by shallow stacks of standard ReLU layers, regardless of their width. In order to identify tractable special cases to prove lower bounds on the necessary number of hidden layers to compute the max function, two approaches have been pursued so far. The first restricts the possible *breakpoints* of all neurons in a network computing x → max0, x1,    , xd. A breakpoint of a neuron is an input for which the function computed by the neuron is non-differentiable. A
neural network is called B0d*-conforming* if breakpoints only appear where the ordering of some pair of coordinates changes (i.e., all breakpoints lie on hyperplanes xi = xj or xi = 0). While B0d-conforming networks can compute the max function with ⌈log2(d + 1)⌉ hidden layers, Hertrich et al. [2023] show that 2 hidden layers are insufficient to compute the function max0, x1, x2, x3, x4, using a computational proof via a mixed integer programming formulation of the problem. The second approach restricts the weights of the network. Averkov et al. [2025] show that, if all weights are N-ary fractions, the max function can only be represented by neural network with depth Ω( log d log log N 
)
by extending an approach of Haase et al. [2023]. Furthermore, Bakaev et al. [2025a] proved lower bounds for the case when some or all weights are restricted to be nonnegative. To the best of our knowledge, the two approaches of restricting either the breakpoints or the weights are incomparable. Our contributions We follow the approach from Hertrich et al. [2023] and prove lower bounds on B0d-conforming networks. On one hand, following Hertrich et al. [2023], we believe that understanding B0d-conforming networks might also shed light on the expressivity of general networks, for example, by studying different underlying fans instead of focusing on the braid fan as an intermediate step. On the other hand, B0d-conforming also appears in Brandenburg et al. [2025] and Froese et al. [2025b]
due to the connection to submodular functions and graphs.

In Section 4 we prove for d = 22ℓ−1 that the function x → max0, x1,    , xd is not representable with a B0d-conforming ReLU network with ℓ hidden layers. This means that depth Ω(log log d) is necessary for computing all CPWL functions, yielding the first conditional non-constant lower bound without restricting the weights of the neural networks. To prove our results, the first observation is that the set of functions that are representable by a B0d-conforming network forms a finite-dimensional vector space (Proposition 2.2). While one would like to identify subspaces of this vector space representable with a certain number of layers, taking the maximum of two functions does not behave well with the structure of linear subspaces. To remedy this, we identify a suitable sequence of subspaces FL(k) for k = 1, 2,    that can be controlled through an inductive construction. These auxiliary subspaces arise from the correspondence between B0d-conforming functions and set functions. This allows us to employ the combinatorial structure of the collection of all subsets of a finite ground set. This is also reflected in the structure of the breakpoints of B0d-conforming functions. Hence, we are able to show that applying a rank-2-maxoutlayer to functions in FL(k) yields a function in FL(k2 +k). Iterating this argument yields the desired bounds. In Section 5, we focus on the case d = 4. We provide a combinatorial proof of the result of Hertrich et al. [2023] showing that the function x → max0, x1, x2, x3, x4 is not representable by a B0d-conforming ReLU network with two hidden layers.

Finally, in Section 6, we study maxout networks as natural generalization of ReLU networks. A
straightforward generalization of the upper bound of Arora et al. [2018] shows that B0d-conforming maxout network with ranks ri in the hidden layers i = 1,    , ℓ can compute the maximum of ℓi=1 ri numbers. We prove that this upper bound is not tight: a maxout network with one rank-3 layer and one rank-2 layer can compute the maximum of 7 numbers, that is, the function x → max0, x1,    , x6.

Further Related Work In light of the prominent role of the max function for neural network expressivity, Safran et al. [2024] studied efficient neural network approximations of the max function. In an extensive line of research, tradeoffs between depth and size of neural networks have been explored, demonstrating that deep networks can be exponentially more compact than shallow ones [Montúfar et al., 2014, Telgarsky, 2016, Eldan and Shamir, 2016, Arora et al., 2018, Ergen and Grillo, 2024]. While most of these works also involve lower bounds on the depth, they are usually proven under assumptions on the width. In contrast, we aim towards proving lower bounds on the depth for unrestricted width. The opposite perspective, namely studying bounds on the size of neural networks irrespective of the depth, has been subject to some research using methods from combinatorial optimization [Hertrich and Skutella, 2023, Hertrich and Sering, 2024, Hertrich and Loho, 2024].

One of the crucial techniques in expressivity questions lies in connections to tropical geometry via Newton polytopes of functions computed by neural networks. This was initiated by Zhang et al. [2018], see also Maragos et al. [2021], and subsequently used to understand decision boundaries, bounds on the depth, size, or number of linear pieces, and approximation capabilities [Montúfar et al.,
2022, Misiakos et al., 2022, Haase et al., 2023, Brandenburg et al., 2024, Valerdi, 2024, Hertrich and Loho, 2024].

## 2 Preliminaries

In Appendix A, the reader can find an overview of the notation used in the paper and in Appendix B detailed proofs of all the statements. Polyhedra We review basic definitions from polyhedral geometry; see Schrijver [1986], Ziegler [2012] for more details. A *polyhedron* P is the intersection of finitely many closed halfspaces and a *polytope* is a bounded polyhedron. A hyperplane *supports* P if it bounds a closed halfspace containing P, and any intersection of P with such a supporting hyperplane yields a *face* F of P. A face is a *proper face* if F ⊊ P and F ̸= ∅ and inclusion-maximal proper faces are referred to as *facets*. A (polyhedral)
cone C ⊆ Rn is a polyhedron such that λu + µv ∈ C for every u, v ∈ C and λ, µ ∈ R≥0. A cone is pointed if it does not contain a line. A cone C is *simplicial*, if there are linearly independent vectors v1,    , vk ∈ Rn such that C = ki=1 λivi  λi ≥ 0.

A *polyhedral complex* P is a finite collection of polyhedra such that (i) ∅ ∈ P, (ii) if P ∈ P then all faces of P are in P, and (iii) if P, P′ ∈ P, then P  P′ is a face both of P and P′. A polyhedral fan is a polyhedral complex where all polyhedra are cones. The *lineality space* of a polyhedron P is defined as v ∈ Rd  x + v ∈ P for all x ∈ P. The lineality space of a polyhedral complex P is the lineality space of one (and therefore all) P ∈ P.

Neural networks and CPWL functions A continuous function f : Rn → R is called *continuous* and piecewise linear (CPWL), if there exists a polyhedral complex P such that the restriction of f to each full-dimensional polyhedron P ∈ Pn is an affine function. If this condition is satisfied, we say that f and P are *compatible* with each other. We denote the set of all CPWL functions from Rd to R
by CPWLd.

For a number of hidden layers ℓ ≥ 0, a *neural network* with *rectied linear unit* (ReLU) activation is defined by a sequence of ℓ + 1 affine maps Ti : Rni−1 → Rni, i ∈ [ℓ + 1]. We assume that n0 = d and nℓ+1 = 1. If σ denotes the function that computes the ReLU function x → maxx, 0 in each component, the neural network is said to compute the CPWL function f : Rd → R given by f = Tℓ+1 ◦ σ ◦ Tℓ ◦ σ ◦ · · · ◦ σ ◦ T1.

A rank-r*-maxout layer* is defined by r affine maps T(q) : Rd → Rn for q ∈ [r] and computes the function x → (max(T(1)x)j ,    ,(T(r)x)j)j∈[n]. For a number of hidden layers ℓ ≥ 0 and a rank vector r = (r1,    , rℓ) ∈ Nℓ, a *rank-r-maxout neural network* is defined by maxout layers fi : Rni−1 → Rni of rank ri for i ∈ [ℓ] respectively and an affine transformation Tout : Rnℓ → R. The rank-r-maxout neural network computes the function f : Rd → R given by f = Tout◦fℓ◦· · ·◦f1. Let Mrd be the set of functions representable by a rank-r-maxout neural network with input dimension d. Moreover, let M2d(ℓ) be the set of functions representable with networks with ℓ rank-2-maxout layers.

## The Braid Arrangement And Set Functions

Denition 2.1. The braid arrangement in Rd *is the hyperplane arrangement consisting of the* d2 hyperplanes xi = xj *, with* 1 ≤ i < j ≤ d*. The* braid fan Bd is the polyhedral fan induced by the braid arrangement.

Sometimes we will also refer to the fan given by the d+1 2 hyperplanes xi = xj and xi = 0 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ d, which we denote by B0d.

We summarize the properties of the braid fan that are relevant for this work. For more details see Stanley [2007]. The k-dimensional cones of Bd are given by cone(1S1 ,    , 1Sk ) + span(1[d])  ∅ ⊊ S1 ⊊ S2 ⊊ · · · ⊊ Sk ⊊ [d],
where 1S = i∈S ei. The braid fan has span(1[d]) as lineality space. Dividing out the lineality space of Bd yields B0d−1. See Figure 1a for an illustration of B0d.

Using the specific structure of the cones of Bd in terms of subsets of [d] allows to relate the vector space VBd of CPWL functions compatible with the braid fan Bd with the vector space of set functions Fd := R2[d]: restricting to the values on 1SS⊆[d] yields a vector space isomorphism Φ: VBd → Fd whose inverse map is given by interpolating the values on 1SS⊆[d] to the interior of the cones of the braid fan. Detailed proofs of all statements can be found in Appendix B.

Proposition 2.2. The linear map Φ: VBd → Fd *given by* F(S) := Φ(f)(S) = f(1S) is an isomorphism.

This implies that VBd has dimension 2d. Another basis for VBd is given by σM  M ∈ 2[d], where the function σM : Rd → R is defined by σM (x) = maxi∈M xi [Danilov and Koshevoy, 2000, Jochemko and Ravichandran, 2022]. We have the following strict containment of linear subspaces:
VBd (0) ⊊ VBd (1) ⊊    ⊊ VBd (d) = VBd where VBd (k) := spanσM  M ⊆ [d], M ≤ k. In order to describe the linear subspaces Φ(VBd (k)), we now describe the isomorphism Φ with respect to the basis σM  M ∈ 2[d].

Let X and Y be finite sets such that X ⊆ Y , then the interval [X, Y ] := S ⊆ [Y ]  X ⊆ S
is a *Boolean lattice* with the partial order given by inclusion. The *rank* of [X, Y ] is given by Y \ X. Sometimes we also write x1 · · · xn for the set x1,    , xn ∈ L and x1 · · · xn for the set X  (Y \ x1,    , xn). For a Boolean lattice L = [X, Y ] of rank n, the *rank function* r : L → [n]0 is given by r(S) = S − X and r(S) is called the *rank* of S. Moreover, we define the *levels* of a Boolean lattice by Li := r−1(i) and introduce the notation L≤i := j≤i Lj for the set of elements whose rank is bounded by i. For S, T ∈ L with S ⊆ T, we call [S, T] a *sublattice* of L and define the vector αS,T ∈ RL by αS,T := S⊆Q⊆T (−1)r(Q)−r(S)1Q. The set FL := (RL)∗ of real-valued functions on L is a vector space, and for any fixed S, T ∈ L, the map F → ⟨αS,T , F⟩ is a linear functional of FL. Furthermore, let RL(k) = spanαS,T  S, T ∈ L, S ⊆ T such that r(T) − r(S) = k + 1 and FL(k) := (RL(k))⊥ = F ∈ FL  ⟨αS,T , F⟩ = 0 for all αS,T ∈ RL(k) be a linear subspace of FL. To simplify notation, we also set Fd(k) := F2[d] (k).

Proposition 2.3. *The isomorphism* Φ: VBd → Fd *maps the function* f = M⊆[d] λM · σM
to the set function dened by F(S) := 
M⊆[d]
MS̸=∅
λM · σM  *The inverse* Φ−1 : Fd → VBd of Φ is given by the Möbius inversion formula F → M⊆[d] −⟨α[d]\M,[d], F⟩. In particular, it holds that Φ(VBd (k)) = Fd(k) for all k ≤ d and dim(Fd(k)) = dim(VBd (k)) = ki=1 di
. See also Figure 1b for an illustration of Proposition 2.3.

## 3 Neural Networks Conforming With The Braid Fan

For a polyhedral complex P, we call a maxout neural network P*-conforming*, if the functions at all neurons are compatible with P. By this we mean that for all i ∈ [ℓ] and all coordinates j of the codomain of fi, the function πj ◦ fi ◦    ◦ f1 is compatible with P, where πj is the projection on the coordinate j. We denote by MrP the set of all functions representable by P-conforming rank-r-maxout networks. For the remainder of this article, we only consider the cases MrBd and MrB0d Lemma 3.1. *The function* x → max0, x1,    , xd−1 can be represented by a B0d−1-conforming rank-r-maxout network if and only if the function x → maxx1,    , xd *can be represented by a* Bd*-conforming rank-r-maxout network.*
By computing ri maxima in each layer, we can compute the basis functions of VBd (ℓi=1 ri) with a Bd-conforming rank-r-maxout network.

Proposition 3.2. For any rank vector r ∈ Nℓ, it holds that all functions in VBd (ℓi=1 ri) are representable by a Bd-conforming rank-r*-maxout network.*
Most of the paper is concerned with proving that MrBd is contained in certain subspaces of VBd . Let FrL = i∈[r] FL be the r-fold direct sum of FL with itself. In order to model the application of the rank-r-maxout activation function for a set function under the isomorphism Φ, we define for (F1,    , Fr) ∈ FrL the function maxF1,    , Fr ∈ FL given by maxF1,    , Fr(S) =
maxF1(S),    , Fr(S).

For f1,    , fr ∈ VBd , the function maxf1,    , fr is Bd-compatible if taking the maximum does not create breakpoints that do not lie on the braid arrangement, that is, on every cone C of the braid arrangement, it holds that maxf1,    , fr = fq for a q ∈ [r]. Next, we aim to model the compatibility with the braid arrangement for set functions. We call a tuple (F1,    , Fr) ∈ FrL
conforming if for every chain ∅ = S0 ⊊ S1 ⊊    ⊊ Sn ⊆ [n] there is a j ∈ [r] such that Fj (Si) = maxF1,    , Fr(Si) for all i ∈ [n]0. Then, the set CrL ⊆ FrL of conforming tuples are exactly those tuples of CPWL functions such that applying the maxout activation function yields a function that is still compatible with the braid fan as stated in the next lemma. Again, to simplify notation, we also set Crd := Cr2[d] . Lemma 3.3. For (F1,    , Fr) ∈ (Fd)r*, the function* maxΦ−1(F1),    , Φ−1(Fr) is Bdconforming if and only if (F1,    , Fr) ∈ Crd*. In this case,*
maxΦ−1(F1),    , Φ−1(Fr) = Φ−1(maxF1,    , Fr)
The statement ensures that taking the maximum of the set functions is the same as taking the maximum of the piecewise-linear functions exactly for compatible tuples.

## 4 Doubly-Logarithmic Lower Bound

In this section, we prove that for any number of layers ℓ ∈ N, the function max0, x1,    , x22ℓ−1 is not computable by a B0d-conforming rank-2-maxout neural network (or equivalently ReLU neural network) with ℓ hidden layers. Due to the equivalence of Bd and B0d, we will prove that M2Bd (ℓ) ⊆
VBd (22ℓ−1) for d ≥ 22ℓ−1 + 1.

First, we define an operation A on subspaces of VBd that describes rank-2-maxout layers that maintain compatibility with Bd. For any subspace U ⊆ VBd , let A(U) ⊆ VBd be the subspace containing all

the functions computable by a Bd-conforming rank 2-maxout layer that takes functions from U as input. Formally, A(U) = spanmaxf1, f2  f1, f2 ∈ U, maxf1, f2 ∈ VBd Clearly, A(U1) is a subspace of A(U2) whenever U1 is a subspace of U2. We recursively define Aℓ(U) = A(Aℓ−1(U)). This recursive definition allows to describe the set of Bd-conforming network with ℓ rank-2-maxout layers M2Bd (ℓ). Lemma 4.1. *It holds that (1)* M2Bd (1) = A(VBd (1)) = VBd (2)*, and (2) for all* ℓ ∈ N,
M2Bd (ℓ) = A(M2Bd (ℓ − 1)) = Aℓ(VBd (1)).

Since it holds that maxf1, f2 = max0, f1 − f2 + f2, we can assume wlog that one of the functions is the zero map, as stated in the following lemma.

Lemma 4.2. *It holds that* A(U) = spanmax0, f  f ∈ U, max0, f ∈ VBd .

To prove that M2Bd (ℓ) = Aℓ(VBd (1)) is a proper subspace of VBd for d ≥ 22ℓ−1 + 1, we perform a layerwise analysis and inductively bound nk depending on k such that A(VBd (k)) ⊆ VBd (nk) for all k ∈ N. In this attempt, we translate this task to the setting of set functions on Boolean lattices using the isomorphism Φ. Recall that the pairs (F1, F2) ∈ C2L are precisely the functions such that the maximum of the corresponding CPWL functions f1 and f2 is still compatible with Bd. Moreover, it is easy to observe, that the pair (0, F) ∈ F2L is conforming if and only if F is contained in the set CL := F ∈ FL  F(S) and F(T) do not have opposite signs for S ⊆ T
Again, to simplify notation, we also set Cd := C2[d] and use the notation F + = max0, F. By slightly overloading notation, for any subspace U ⊆ FL, let A(U) = spanF +  F ∈ U  CL.

Lemma 3.3 justifies this notation and allows us to carry out the argumentation to the world of set functions on Boolean lattices, as we conclude in the following lemma.

Lemma 4.3. *It holds that* A(Φ(U)) = Φ(A(U)) for all subspaces U ⊆ VBd . In particular, for any lattice L = [X, Y ]*, it holds that* A(FL(1)) = FL(2).

In the following, we prove that A(FL(k)) ⊆ FL(k2 +k) by an induction on k and Lemma 4.3 serves as the base case.

Next, we describe properties of the vector space RL that will be useful for the induction step. Every sublattice of L of rank k + 1 is of the form [S, S  T], where S  T = ∅ and T = k + 1. For any T ⊆ Y \ X, one can decompose L = [X, Y ] into the sublattices [S, S  T] for all S ⊆ Y \ T,
resulting in the following lemma.

Lemma 4.4. Let L = [X, Y ] be a lattice of rank n. Then, (1) for every T ⊆ Y \ X*, it holds that* αX,Y ∈ spanαS,ST  S ⊆ Y \ T, and (2) for every T ⊆ Y \ X with T = k*, it holds that* αS,ST − αS′,S′T ∈ RL(k) *for all* S, S′ ∈ [X, Y \ T].

See Figure 2 for a visualization of Lemma 4.4. Lemma 4.4 implies that it suffices to find a T ⊆ Y such that ⟨αS,ST , F +⟩ = 0 for all S ⊆ Y \ T, in order to prove that FL(n − 1). The idea of the

[∅, abc] = [∅, bc]  [a, abc]. The 3 figures illustrate that αS,S{b,c} − αS′,S′{b,c} ∈ RL(2) for all S, S′ ⊆ a, d.

induction step is to find a T of cardinality at least (k−1)2+(k−1)+1 such that F ∈ F[S,ST](k−1)
for all S ⊆ Y \ T. Then, applying the induction hypothesis to each sublattice [S, S  T] yields ⟨αS,ST , F +⟩ = 0 and hence F + ∈ FL(n − 1).

If F ∈ FL(k), Lemma 4.4 implies that for any T′ ⊆ Y \ X of cardinality k, the value ⟨αS′,S′T′ , F⟩ is independent of S′ ⊆ Y \T′. Hence, in this case, it suffices to find a T such that F ∈ F[S,ST](k−1) for only one S ⊆ Y \ T, since it is equivalent to F ∈ F[S,ST](k − 1) for all S ⊆ Y \ T. Given F ∈ FL(k)  CL, it remains to find such S and T. We define the *support* of F ∈ FL by supp(F) = S ∈ L  F(S) ̸= 0 and the *positive and negative support* by supp+(F) = S ∈ L 
F(S) > 0 respectively supp−(F) = S ∈ L  F(S) < 0. In particular, F ∈ CL implies that for X+ ∈ supp+(F) and X− ∈ supp−(F), it holds that F(R) = 0 for all R ⊇ X+  X−.

Lemma 4.5 says that, given that the positive and negative support are not empty, we can always "push the elements X+ and X− in the support down in the lattice", that is, we can find elements in the supports that are of relatively low rank. See Figure 1c for an illustration.

Lemma 4.5. Let L = [X, Y ] be a lattice of rank n. Let F ∈ FL(k)  CL *such that* F ̸≥ 0 and F ̸≤ 0*. Then, there are* X− ∈ L≤k  supp−(F) and X+ ∈ L≤k  supp+ *as well as* Y − ∈ L≥n−k  supp−(F) and Y + ∈ L≥n−k  supp+(F).

Let S = X+  X−, then F ∈ CL implies that for T = Y \ S, we have that F(R) = 0 for all R ∈ [S, S T]. In particular, it holds that F ∈ F[S,ST](k −1). Thus, by Lemma 4.4, if F ∈ FL(k),

it follows that F ∈ F[S′,S′T](k − 1) for all S′ ⊆ Y \ T′. Since S is at most 2k it follows by counting that if n ≥ (k2 + k + 1), the cardinality of T is at least (k − 1)2 + (k − 1) + 1. This allows to apply the inductions hypothesis to all sublattices [S′, S′  T] for S′ ⊆ Y \ T, resulting in the following proposition. See also Figure 3b for an illustration of the induction.

Proposition 4.6. For k ∈ N*, let* L = [X, Y ] *be a lattice of rank* n ≥ k2 +k+ 1 and F ∈ FL(k)CL.

Then it holds that ⟨αX,Y , F +⟩ = 0 Applying Proposition 4.6 to every sublattice of rank k2 + k + 1 allows to sharpen the bound.

Proposition 4.7. Let L be a lattice and k ∈ N*, then it holds that* A(FL(k)) ⊆ FL(k2 + k).

Translating this result back to the CPWL functions and applying the argument iteratively for a rank-2-maxout network, layer by layer, we obtain the following theorem.

Theorem 4.8. For a number of layers ℓ ∈ N*, it holds that* M2Bd (ℓ) ⊆ VBd (22ℓ−1).

Corollary 4.9. *The function* x → 0, x1,    , x22ℓ−1  is not computable by a B0d-conforming ReLU
neural network with ℓ *hidden layers.*

## 5 Combinatorial Proof For Dimension Four

In this section, we prove that the function max0, x1,    , x4 cannot be computed by a B0dconforming rank-(2, 2)-maxout networks or equivalently ReLU neural networks with 2 hidden layers. This completely classfies the set of functions computable by Bd-conforming ReLU neural networks with 2 hidden layers.

If L is a lattice of rank 5 and F ∈ FL(2)  CL, we know by Lemma 4.5, given that the supports of F are not empty, that there are X+ ∈ L2  supp+(F) and X− ∈ L2  supp−(F). We first argue that in the special case of rank 5 we can even assume that there are X+ ∈ L1  supp+(F) and X− ∈ L1 supp−(F). Then, with analogous arguments as in Section 4, we prove that F + ∈ FL(4),
resulting in the sharp bound for rank-(2, 2)-maxout networks.

If the positive support of a function F ∈ FL(2)  CL is contained in the levels L2 and L3, then for every S ∈ supp+(F) L2 there must be a T ∈ supp+(F)L3 such that T ⊇ S and F(S) ≤ F(T)
since ⟨αS,Y , F⟩ = 0. Applying the same argument to T, we conclude that F(S) = F(T) and that there are no further subsets in supp+(F) that are comparable to S or T. Thus, we can match the subsets S ∈ L2 with the subsets T ∈ L3 such that F(S) = F(T) and hence it follows that
⟨αX,Y , F +⟩ = S∈L2 F +(S)−T ∈L3 F +(T) = 0. By symmetry, the same holds if supp−(F) ⊆
L2  L3. See Figure 4 for an illustration. Following this idea, we state the lemma for a more general case.

Lemma 5.1. Let L = [X, Y ] be a lattice of rank n and F ∈ FL(k)  CL *with* n ≥ 2k + 1*. If* there are i, j ∈ [n]0 *such that* supp+(F) ⊆ Li  Lj or supp−(F) ⊆ Li  Lj *, then it holds that* F + ∈ FL(n − 1). If there is a X+ ∈ L1  supp+(F) and a X− ∈ L4  supp−(F), then it holds that ⟨αX,Y , F +⟩ =
⟨αX+,Y , F⟩ = 0 (Figure 4 and Lemma B.1 in the appendix). Thus we can assume that there are X+ ∈ L1  supp+(F) and X− ∈ L1  supp−(F). By proceeding analogously as in Section 4, we prove the following theorem.

Theorem 5.2. *It holds that* M2Bd (2) = VBd (4)*. In particular, the function* x → 0, x1,    , x4 is not computable by a B0d-conforming ReLU neural network with 2 *hidden layers.*

## 6 The Unimaginable Power Of Maxouts

By Proposition 3.2, all functions in VBd (ℓi=1 ri) are representable by a Bd-conforming rank-rmaxout network. In Section 5, we have seen that this bound is tight for the rank vector (2, 2). In this section, we prove that this bound in general is not tight by demonstrating that the function x → 0, x1,    , x6 is computable by a B0d-conforming rank-(3, 2)-maxout network.

Proposition 6.1. Let f1, f2 ∈ VB7 (3) *be the functions given by* f1 = 2 · σ{1,2} + σ{1,4,5} + σ{1,6,7} + σ{2,4,6} + σ{2,5,7} f2 = σ{3,4,5} + σ{3,6,7} + σ{1,2,4} + σ{1,2,5} + σ{1,2,6} + σ{1,2,7}
Then it holds that maxf1, f2 ∈ VB7 (7) \ VB7 (6).

Proof Sketch. Let F1 = Φ(f1) and F2 = Φ(f2). We write i1 · · ·in for i1,    , in and i1 · · ·in for [7] \ i1,    , in and note that the sublattices [12, 3], [13, 2], [23, 1], [3, 12], [2, 13], [1, 23], [∅, 123], [123, [7]] form a partition of [∅, [7]].

We first show that on any of the above sublattices except [1, 23], either F1 or F2 attains the maximum on all elements of the sublattice and that for F := F1−F2 it holds that supp+(F) ⊆ [1, 23]146167 and ⟨α[∅,[7]], F 
+⟩ = ⟨α12,3, F⟩ − F(146) − F(167) = −2 and thus F + ∈ FL \ FL(6). Then by looking at the partition into sublattices, we argue that F ∈ CL and thus by Lemma 3.3, we conclude that maxf1, f2 ∈ VB7 \ VB7 (6).

Hence maxf1, f2 = M⊆[7] λmσM with λ[7] ̸= 0 and since all functions in VBd (6) are computable by a rank-(3, 2)-maxout network, we conclude that x → x1,    , x7 is computable by a rank-(3, 2)-maxout network or equivalently:
Theorem 6.2. *The function* x → 0, x1,    , x6 *is computable by a rank-*(3, 2)*-maxout network.* Remark 6.3. *One can check (e.g., with a computer) that* x → 0, x1,    , x6 is computable by a rank-(3, 2)-maxout network with integral weights. This is particularly interesting in light of Haase et al. [2023], who prove a ⌈log2(d + 1)⌉ lower bound for the case of integral weights and ReLU
networks.

## 7 Conclusion And Limitations

Characterizing the set of functions that a ReLU network with a fixed number of layers can compute remains an open problem. We established a doubly-logarithmic lower bound under the assumption that breakpoints lie on the braid fan. This assumption allowed us to exploit specific combinatorial properties of the braid arrangement. In the specific case of four dimensions, we reprove the tight bound for B0d-conforming networks of Hertrich et al. [2023] with combinatorial arguments. Given that Bakaev et al. [2025b] showed that one can compute the maximum of 5 numbers with 2-layers, this implies that considering B0d-conforming networks is a real restriction. While this indicates that the doubly-logarithmic lower bound may not extend to all networks, our approach provides a foundation for adapting these techniques toward more general depth lower bounds, for example, by looking at different underlying fans instead of just the braid fan.

## Neurips Paper Checklist

1. Claims Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: All claimed results are proven in the main part or appendix. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.

- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.

- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

## 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We clearly and openly discuss the assumptions and limitations of our theorems in the introduction and the theorem statements. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. - The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.

- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.

- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.

- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.

- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.

- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

## 3. Theory Assumptions And Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All assumptions are mentioned in the statements. All proofs are given in the main text or appendix.

Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. - All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.

- All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. - The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.

- Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.

- Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

## 4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No experiments. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. - If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.

- If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.

- Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.

- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

## 5. Open Access To Data And Code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [NA] Justification: No experiments. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. - Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

- While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).

- The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

- The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.

- The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

- At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).

- Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

## 6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: No experiments.

Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. - The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

## 7. Experiment Statistical Signicance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: No experiments. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. - The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

- The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

- The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). - It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

- It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.

- For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).

- If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

## 8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: No experiments. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. - The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

- The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

- The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

## 9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Purely theoretical research. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. - If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.

- The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

## 10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Purely theoretical research. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. - If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

- Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

- The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.

- The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

- If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

## 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Purely theoretical research. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. - Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.

- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

## 12. Licenses For Existing Assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: No assets used.

Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. - The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. - The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.

- The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. - For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

- If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

- For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

- If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

## 13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: No new assets. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. - Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.

- The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.

- At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

## 14. Crowdsourcing And Research With Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing or research with human subjects. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

- Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.

- According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human

## Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: No crowdsourcing or research with human subjects. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

- Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.

- We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.

- For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

## 16. Declaration Of Llm Usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required. Answer: [NA] Justification: No non-standard LLM usage. Guidelines:
- The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.

- Please refer to our LLM policy (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/
LLM) for what should or should not be described.
