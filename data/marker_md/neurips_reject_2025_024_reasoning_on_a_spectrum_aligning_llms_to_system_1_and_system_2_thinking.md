### Abstract

 Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their reliance on step-by-step reasoning can make them brittle when tasks do not align with such structured approaches. In contrast, human cognition flexibly alternates between fast, intuitive reasoning (System 1) and slow, analytical reason- ing (System 2), depending on context. To bridge this gap, we curate a dataset of 2K examples, each with valid responses from both reasoning styles, and explicitly align LLMs with System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Evaluations across diverse reasoning benchmarks reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense tasks. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive answers, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Interpolating between these extremes produces a monotonic transition in reasoning accuracy, preserving coherence. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.[<sup>1</sup>](#page-0-0)

### 1 Introduction

 LLMs have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, often achieving near-human or even superhuman performance [\(Huang and Chang, 2023\)](#page-10-0). These advances have largely been driven by techniques that simulate step-by-step, deliberative reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and inference-time interventions [\(Wei et al., 2022b;](#page-13-0) [Wang et al., 2022\)](#page-13-1). Given their success, such methods are increasingly integrated into LLM training [\(Chung et al., 2024\)](#page-9-0), reinforcing explicit, structured reasoning regardless of the task necessity. However, the increasing focus on step-by-step reasoning has revealed limitations such as brittle generalization, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced judgment [\(Delétang et al., 2023\)](#page-9-1), logical consistency [\(Jiang et al., 2024\)](#page-10-1), or adaptability to uncertainty [\(Mirzadeh et al., 2024\)](#page-11-0). Similarly, recent analyses frame this issue as "overthinking": [Cuadron et al.](#page-9-2) [\(2025\)](#page-9-2); [Chen et al.](#page-9-3) [\(2024\)](#page-9-3) demonstrate that excessive deliberation can hamper decision-making. This problem appears in LLMs' responses to simple factual queries, where they often generate unnecessarily explanations instead of direct responses [\(Wang et al., 2023\)](#page-13-2).

 This focus on explicit, structured reasoning highlights a key difference between LLMs and human cognition: while LLMs are being pushed towards a single mode of processing, human reasoning is far more nuanced. Rather than a monolithic process, human reasoning emerges from a sophisticated suite of cognitive tools evolved to tackle a *spectrum* of computational problems. This spectrum of human reasoning encompasses both automatic and reflective processes, a key insight recognized across

[d](#page-9-5)iverse fields from behavioral economics to psychology and neuroscience [\(Daw et al., 2005;](#page-9-4) [Dolan](#page-9-5) [and Dayan, 2013;](#page-9-5) [Balleine and Dickinson, 1998\)](#page-9-6). On one end lie computationally *light* problems demanding rapid, intuitive judgments (e.g., instinctively dodging a speeding car), handled by the reflexive "System 1." On the other end are *heavy* problems requiring deliberate, step-by-step analysis, managed by the reflective "System 2" [\(Kahneman, 2011;](#page-11-1) [Stanovich and West, 2000\)](#page-12-0). This dual- process system allows us to dynamically shift between modes depending on the task, balancing speed and accuracy [\(Evans and Stanovich, 2013\)](#page-10-2). Extensive work in neuroscience in the past two decades links the dual-process framework and human decision strategies, which depicts decision-making on a spectrum between a fast but reflexive habitual decision strategy and a reflective goal-directed strategy [\(Daw et al., 2005;](#page-9-4) [Dolan and Dayan, 2013\)](#page-9-5). Experimental work in neuroscience is built on the relative advantages of these two strategies, the separate but overlapping neural structures supporting them, and the circumstances under which each system is deployed in the brain [\(Daw et al.,](#page-9-7) [2011;](#page-9-7) [Schad et al., 2020;](#page-12-1) [Piray and Daw, 2021\)](#page-12-2). Given the evolutionary advantage of humans in switching between fast and slow thinking to balance speed, efficiency, and accuracy, exploring LLMs through the lens of System 1 and System 2 reasoning offers a powerful way to address their current limitations.

[W](#page-10-3)hile recent studies explore whether LLMs exhibit System 1 and System 2 behaviors [\(Hagendorff](#page-10-3) [et al., 2023;](#page-10-3) [Pan et al., 2024\)](#page-12-3) or propose hybrid models [\(Yang et al., 2024;](#page-13-3) [Deng et al., 2024\)](#page-9-8), most prior work implicitly assumes that structured, deliberative reasoning is universally superior. Even research suggesting LLMs' capacity for both reasoning modes [\(Wang and Zhou, 2024\)](#page-13-4) largely overlooks the crucial question of when each mode is indeed advantageous. The assumption that a single "best" reasoning strategy can apply across all contexts is a fundamental simplification that limits current approaches in LLM development. This assumption prevents LLMs from achieving true cognitive flexibility, hindering their ability to adapt their reasoning processes to diverse situations.

 To address this gap, we explicitly align LLMs with System 1 and System 2 reasoning and evaluate their reasoning capabilities and behaviors across a range of reasoning benchmarks. Our approach involves designing an experimental setup where both thinking styles can produce valid responses but follow distinct paths, one leveraging intuitive heuristics, and the other prioritizing deliberate, step-by-step reasoning. By systematically assessing how reasoning styles and cognitive biases affect downstream task performance, we provide insights into when intuitive heuristics or structured deliberation are most effective, and highlight the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency in LLMs.

 Specifically, as demonstrated in Figure [1,](#page-3-0) we first curate a dataset of 2,000 reasoning questions, where each problem has both a fast, heuristic-driven (System 1) response and a deliberative, structured (System 2) response, grounded in 10 different cognitive heuristics [\(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974\)](#page-12-4). We then explicitly align LLMs with either System 1 or System 2 type responses and evaluate these models on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal a structured accuracy-efficiency trade- off and demonstrate that different reasoning paradigms in LLMs excel at different types of tasks, mirroring how humans selectively rely on fast or slow thinking depending on task demands: System 2-aligned models consistently outperform instruction-tuned and CoT prompt baselines in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, demonstrating superior multi-step inference, but generating more extended token-intensive responses. Conversely, System 1-aligned models generate more succinct responses and excel at commonsense reasoning, where heuristic shortcuts are effective. Importantly, unlike CoT models, which always engage in structured reasoning regardless of necessity, our models provide an explicit way to study when different reasoning styles are beneficial, mirroring the well-known efficiency-accuracy trade-off in human cognition [\(Keramati et al., 2011;](#page-11-2) [Mattar and Daw, 2018\)](#page-11-3). By framing LLM reasoning as a structured and adaptable process, rather than simply an ability to achieve higher benchmark scores, this work highlights the importance of selecting the right reasoning strategy for a given task. This perspective not only aligns LLM reasoning more closely with human cognition but also paves the way for more flexible, efficient, and robust reasoning systems, setting a foundation for future advancements in LLM reasoning.

### 2.1 Reasoning in LLMs

 Driven by extensive research highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of LLM reasoning abili-[t](#page-12-6)ies (e.g., [Huang and Chang, 2022;](#page-10-4) [Mondorf and Plank, 2024;](#page-11-4) [Valmeekam et al., 2022;](#page-12-5) [Parmar](#page-12-6)

[et al., 2024;](#page-12-6) [Sourati et al., 2024\)](#page-12-7), recent efforts to enhance these capabilities have largely focused on prompting techniques [\(Brown et al., 2020\)](#page-9-9), ranging from zero-shot prompting with explicit in- structions [\(Kojima et al., 2022;](#page-11-5) [Wang et al., 2023;](#page-13-2) [Zhou et al., 2024b\)](#page-14-0) to few-shot prompting with step-by-step examples [\(Wei et al., 2022b\)](#page-13-0). [Wang and Zhou](#page-13-4) [\(2024\)](#page-13-4) take CoT prompting even one step further and demonstrate that CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the decoding process without the use of a specific prompt. Related approaches, such as self-consistency decoding [Wang et al.](#page-13-1) [\(2022\)](#page-13-1), explore how diverse reasoning paths can enhance robustness, aligning with deliberative aspects of System 2 reasoning. Tree of Thought (ToT; [Yao et al.,](#page-13-5) [2024\)](#page-13-5) generalizes over CoT and allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make a global choice. Another alternative way of increasing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is through instruction tuning on a substantial [a](#page-11-6)mount of CoT reasoning data [Chung et al.](#page-9-0) [\(2024\)](#page-9-0); [Huang et al.](#page-10-5) [\(2022\)](#page-10-5) or distillation [Magister](#page-11-6) [et al.](#page-11-6) [\(2022\)](#page-11-6). By training LLMs on a large-scale CoT dataset, models can internalize step-by-step reasoning, potentially enhancing their performance across diverse benchmarks without relying solely on prompting techniques. Concurrent studies have identified an "overthinking" phenomenon in [L](#page-9-3)LMs, where models produce excessively detailed or unnecessarily elaborate reasoning steps [\(Chen](#page-9-3) [et al., 2024;](#page-9-3) [Cuadron et al., 2025\)](#page-9-2).

#### 2.2 Dual-Process Theory in NLP

 Dual-process theories, widely studied in psychology, distinguish between fast, intuitive reasoning (System 1) and slow, deliberate reasoning (System 2). While these theories have long explained the spectrum of human reasoning, their application in NLP remains underexplored. Existing research falls into two main categories: (1) analyzing LLMs' reasoning through dual-process theory, identifying similarities and differences between LLMs and human reasoning, and (2) developing models with dual-process mechanisms to enhance LLM reasoning and leverage the benefits of both systems.

 Analyzing LLMs' reasoning through dual-process theory. Researchers have investigated whether LLMs exhibit reasoning behaviors aligned with System 1 and System 2, particularly in terms of cognitive human-like errors and biases [\(Hagendorff et al., 2023;](#page-10-3) [Booch et al., 2021;](#page-9-10) [Pan et al., 2024;](#page-12-3) [Echterhoff et al., 2024;](#page-9-11) [Zeng et al., 2024\)](#page-13-6). [Hagendorff et al.](#page-10-3) [\(2023\)](#page-10-3) examine cognitive heuristics in [L](#page-9-10)LMs, showing that newer models exhibit fewer errors characteristic of System 1 thinking. [Booch](#page-9-10) [et al.](#page-9-10) [\(2021\)](#page-9-10) discuss fundamental questions regarding the role of dual-process theory in machine learning but leave practical implementation as an open problem. Most of these studies evaluate LLMs on benchmarks where System 2 reasoning is assumed to be superior, portraying intuitive responses as erroneous, even though such rapid, heuristic-driven judgments are often crucial for efficient and effective reasoning in real-world scenarios. In contrast, by analyzing models aligned with System 1 and System 2 reasoning using a carefully curated dataset where both response types are valid, we offer a more nuanced understanding of how this alignment influences broader model behavior.

 Incorporating dual-process theory in NLP models. Several studies have integrated dual-process- inspired reasoning into LLMs. Some works combine intuitive (fast) and deliberate (slow) components to improve reasoning [\(He et al., 2024;](#page-10-6) [Liu et al., 2022;](#page-11-7) [Hua and Zhang, 2022;](#page-10-7) [Pan et al., 2024\)](#page-12-3), while others optimize reasoning efficiency by distilling System 2 insights into System 1 models [\(Yang et al.,](#page-13-3) [2024;](#page-13-3) [Deng et al., 2024;](#page-9-8) [Yu et al., 2024\)](#page-13-7). Additionally, research has leveraged System 2 reasoning to [m](#page-10-8)itigate biases associated with System 1 heuristics, improving fairness and robustness [\(Furniturewala](#page-10-8) [et al., 2024;](#page-10-8) [Kamruzzaman and Kim, 2024;](#page-11-8) [Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023\)](#page-13-8). While prior work largely frames System 2 reasoning as superior or explicitly builds dual-process components within models, our approach investigates the implicit effects of aligning LLMs to System 1 or System 2 responses. By analyzing how these heuristics influence general reasoning capabilities, we address a gap in the literature and provide new insights into the broader cognitive behaviors of LLMs that have implications for how unseen properties of data that LLMs are trained on can affect their capabilities.

### 3 Method

#### 3.1 Aligning LLMs to System 1 & System 2 Thinking

 We formalize the modeling of fast and slow thinking as an alignment problem using a curated dataset in which each reasoning question is paired with both a System 1 (intuitive) and a System 2 (analytical) response (see Section [3.2\)](#page-3-1). We align LLMs to either reasoning style via a preference-based training approach: for System 1 alignment, the intuitive response is designated as the preferred (winner) and the analytical response as the non-preferred (loser); for System 2 alignment, this preference is reversed, treating the analytical response as the winner and the intuitive response as the loser.

 This approach is effective for two key reasons. First, our aim is not to introduce new knowledge or instructions but rather to shape the model's reasoning process based on existing capabilities. Second, previous research has shown that prompt engineering can guide LLMs toward System 2 reasoning [\(Wei et al., 2022a\)](#page-13-9) or System 1 reasoning [\(Zhou et al., 2024a\)](#page-13-10), suggesting that LLMs already have both reasoning abilities. Therefore, instead of creating new reasoning pathways, we guide the model to distinguish between intuitive and analytical reasoning processes without altering its underlying knowledge. The next section describes the dataset creation process that enables this training setup.

#### 3.2 Dataset of System 1 & System 2 Thinking

 Our curated dataset consists of 2,000 questions designed to elicit two distinct reasoning styles in English: one intuitive and rapid, reflecting cognitive shortcuts (System 1), and the other deliberate and analytical (System 2). This dual structure allows us to study the distinct mechanisms underlying System 1 and System 2 reasoning [\(Kahneman, 2011;](#page-11-1) [Stanovich and West, 2000;](#page-12-0) [Evans and Stanovich,](#page-10-2) [2013\)](#page-10-2). The dataset was created in three key phases: Generation, Refinement, and Validation.

 Generation. Cognitive heuristics provide a practical foundation for distinguishing between System 1 and System 2 reasoning, where both yield valid but behaviorally distinct responses [\(Kahneman,](#page-11-1) [2011\)](#page-11-1). To construct our dataset, we adopted a human-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages GPT-4o [\(Hurst et al., 2024\)](#page-10-9) to scale up the number of high-quality reasoning examples. In line with recent work on dataset creation using LLMs and few-shot prompting [\(Xu et al., 2023;](#page-13-11) [Wang et al., 2022\)](#page-13-1), we used a one-shot prompting setup, where each generation is guided by a carefully selected example grounded in a particular cognitive heuristic. These seed examples were authored by domain experts (see Appendix [D\)](#page-15-0) and span 10 well-known heuristics from [Kahneman](#page-11-1) [\(2011\)](#page-11-1) (Appendix [C\)](#page-14-1). For each, experts provided a reasoning question accompanied by both a System 1 (heuristic) and System 2 (deliberative) response. During expansion, the prompt included the formal definition of each heuristic, a description of how both systems typically approach it, and the expert-written example. This setup enabled the model to generate new reasoning items aligned with distinct cognitive patterns. Full prompt details are provided in Appendix [F,](#page-15-1) and expert-authored examples are shown in Appendix [E.](#page-15-2)

 Refinement. As a byproduct of the data generation process, System 2 outputs were significantly longer and more detailed—reflecting their step-by-step reasoning style, while System 1 outputs were shorter and more direct; this length difference was confirmed using Welch's t-test, t(2090.1) = −184.74, p < .001, d = −5.84. Prior work demonstrates that alignment methods can rely on superficial cues, such as output length, favoring longer responses even when they offer no real reasoning advantage [\(Singhal et al., 2023\)](#page-12-8). To prevent this bias, we use zero-shot prompting with

 GPT-4o to match the lengths of our System 1 and System 2 outputs while preserving their content. Adjustments were applied only when there was a significant length disparity. More details about the prompt and the length disparity threshold are described in Appendix [J.](#page-16-0) By reducing the length disparity, we minimized any preference for System 2 outputs arising from their longer responses. After adjustment, System 1 outputs had an average length of 82.19 tokens, while System 2 outputs averaged 83.93 tokens. A two one-sided t-test (TOST) confirmed the equivalence of post-adjustment lengths across various token counts as equivalence margins (see Appendix [I\)](#page-16-1), indicating that the adjustment effectively eliminated significant length differences between the two response types.

 Verification. Prior works show that high-quality, expert-supervised datasets of this scale are common and effective for fine-tuning LLMs [\(Xiao et al., 2024;](#page-13-12) [Dumpala et al., 2024;](#page-9-12) [Li et al., 2024\)](#page-11-9). Following this precedent to ensure data quality, we had our domain experts conform all generated data to formal definitions of System 1 and System 2 thinking, and ensured that the dataset covers the intended set of cognitive heuristics across varied subject areas. In this process, the experts manually revised approximately 20% of the responses. We further verified the breadth of topic coverage via topic modeling; see Appendix [G](#page-15-3) for details. A subset of the curated dataset is shown in Table [1.](#page-4-0)

### <sup>192</sup> 4 Experiments Setup

### <sup>193</sup> 4.1 Alignment Algorithm

 To implement the alignment strategy for System 1 and System 2 reasoning, we utilize two offline preference optimization methods, namely, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; [Rafailov et al.,](#page-12-9) [2024\)](#page-12-9) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO; [Meng et al., 2024\)](#page-11-10), because (i) their offline formulation removes the costly on-policy sampling loop, yielding a simpler and more compute- efficient training pipeline, and (ii) our hand-crafted preference pairs capture fine-grained relational signals that would likely be blurred by online-generated pairs.

 DPO is an offline alignment method that fine-tunes LLMs by comparing the preferred and disfavored outputs of a model against a reference model, optimizing preferences without requiring a separate reward model. As a prominent method in preference optimization, DPO has gained traction for its stability and efficiency, making it a widely adopted alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF; [Ouyang et al., 2022\)](#page-12-10). SimPO builds on the principles of DPO but introduces a reference-free approach to preference optimization. Instead of requiring a separate reference model, SimPO aligns responses by directly optimizing preference signals within the model itself. This makes it computationally more efficient and removes the dependency on an external reference model, offering a streamlined alternative for aligning LLMs to a specific preference.

#### 4.2 Benchmarks

 We evaluate our System 1 and System 2 models using 13 reasoning benchmarks across three different categories: (1) arithmetic reasoning: MultiArith [\(Roy and Roth, 2015\)](#page-12-11), GSM8K [\(Cobbe et al., 2021\)](#page-9-13), AddSub [Hosseini et al.](#page-10-10) [\(2014\)](#page-10-10), AQUA-RAT [\(Ling et al., 2017\)](#page-11-11), SingleEq [\(Koncel-Kedziorski et al.,](#page-11-12) [2015\)](#page-11-12), and SVAMP [\(Patel et al., 2021\)](#page-12-12); (2) commonsense reasoning: CSQA [\(Talmor et al., 2019\)](#page-12-13), StrategyQA [\(Geva et al., 2021\)](#page-10-11), PIQA [\(Bisk et al., 2020\)](#page-9-14), SIQA [\(Sap et al., 2019\)](#page-12-14), and COM2SENSE [\(Singh et al., 2021\)](#page-12-15); (3) symbolic reasoning: Last Letter Concatenation and Coin Flip [Wei et al.](#page-13-0) [\(2022b\)](#page-13-0). More details about the benchmarks are in Appendix [H.](#page-16-2)

 Following [Kong et al.](#page-11-13) [\(2024\)](#page-11-13), our evaluation follows a two-stage process. In the first stage, we present benchmark questions to model and record its responses. In the second stage, we prompt the model with the original question, its initial response, and benchmark-specific instructions to ensure the output is formatted as required. See Appendix [K](#page-17-0) for each benchmark's instructions.

### 4.3 Implementation Details

 We use Llama-3-8B-Instruct [\(AI@Meta, 2024\)](#page-9-15) and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 [\(Jiang et al., 2023\)](#page-10-12) as SFT models for alignment. Following [Kojima et al.](#page-11-14) [\(2023\)](#page-11-14), we compare the performance of these aligned models against their instruction-tuned counterparts under zero-shot and zero-shot CoT prompting (additional details in Appendix [L\)](#page-17-1). To analyze the model's behavior along the System 1 to System 2 reasoning spectrum, we train seven intermediate models, where the winner responses are mixed at predefined ratios between System 1 and System 2. This structured interpolation allows us to systematically assess whether the transition between reasoning styles is discrete or gradual.

# 5 Results

### 5.1 Distinct Strengths of System 1 & System 2 Models

 Table [2](#page-6-0) shows a comparison of exact matching accuracy across 13 benchmarks for Llama and Mistral. Specifically, we compare the base models with the System 1 and System 2 variants, and include results for CoT prompting for reference. Our findings reveal distinct performance trends for the System 1 and System 2 models, highlighting their respective strengths in different reasoning benchmarks.

 In all arithmetic benchmarks (MultiArith, GSM8K, AddSub, AQuA, and SingleEq), System 2 models outperformed both the base model and their System 1 counterpart, evident for both Llama and Mistral. This improvement is most significant in the AddSub and SingleEq benchmarks. Similarly, System 2 models outperformed System 1 models in nearly all symbolic reasoning benchmarks (Coin, Letter), which require pattern recognition and logical structuring, further validating the idea that deliberative, slow-thinking models enhance performance in structured reasoning. While both approaches achieve high accuracy, System 1's heuristic shortcuts introduce small but systematic errors that System 2's deliberate, stepwise computations tend to avoid, such as rounding the number or adding numbers without checking. This is further supported by our AddSub analysis (see Appendix [O\)](#page-18-0).

 Conversely, System 1 models excelled both their System 2 counterparts and the base model as well as the CoT variant on all commonsense reasoning benchmarks (CSQA, StrategyQA, PIQA, SIQA, COM2SENSE), which depend on intuitive judgments and heuristic shortcuts. While System 2 reasoning is correct, its deliberate nature can often lead to overthinking, producing overly cautious or extensively interpretive responses that diverge from typical human reactions in rapid, intuitive situations. For example, when asked what a kindergarten teacher does before nap time, System 2 suggests "encourage quiet behavior" instead of "tell a story," or predicts "laughter" rather than "fight" if you surprise an angry person. As shown in Appendix [O,](#page-18-0) this preference for completeness over contextual fit makes System 2 less reliable for quick, socially grounded tasks.

 When comparing Llama and Mistral, Llama models generally achieved higher accuracy across all benchmarks. This suggests that Llama may have stronger foundational reasoning capabilities, which are further enhanced by the System 2 and System 1 alignment. Moreover, instruction-tuned models equipped with the CoT prompt exhibited only marginal differences compared to their base counterparts because step-by-step reasoning has already been internalized during pretraining on CoT- style data [\(AI@Meta, 2024\)](#page-9-15), reducing the need for explicit prompting. Based on this observation, we use the base Llama model as our primary baseline in subsequent experiments.

 In summary, our results showcase that System 2 models excel in structured, multi-step reasoning such as arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1 models are effective in intuitive and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. These findings highlight the significant potential of dual-process alignment for boosting LLM performance across a diverse range of reasoning paradigms.

#### <sup>264</sup> 5.2 Length Differences Across Reasoning Styles

Figure 2: Token difference between System 1 and System 2 responses relative to Llama3 model across stages and alignment methods.

 A recent trend in LLM performance, exempli- [fi](#page-11-15)ed by models such as DeepSeek R1 [\(Muen-](#page-11-15) [nighoff et al., 2025\)](#page-11-15), is that achieving stronger benchmark results often correlates with produc- ing longer reasoning chains, even if not explic- itly trained to do so. This correlation raises the question of whether such verbose responses truly reflect enhanced reasoning capabilities or if they are simply a formatting artifact of cur- rent high-performing models. In our studies, this concern is particularly relevant for System 2 models, which are expected to behave more deliberatively. To investigate this, we analyze output lengths across the two-stage prompting setup described in Section [4.2.](#page-5-0)

![](_page_6_Figure_5.jpeg)

 As shown in Figure [2,](#page-6-1) System 2-aligned models generate significantly longer responses than their System 1 counterparts, relative to the Llama baseline, under both alignment methods, DPO (t(8836) = 57.14, p < .001) and SimPO (t(8586) = 9.833, p < .001). This difference emerges specifically in the second stage, where models are prompted to finalize their responses, while response lengths remain comparable in the first stage, where both models are simply asked to reason. Although both models were trained on equal-length preference pairs (Section [3.2\)](#page-3-1), System 2 models still tend to elaborate more during finalization, consistent with their alignment toward deliberative reasoning.

 While longer reasoning chains are often associated with stronger performance, our findings suggest that this extended reasoning can also introduce inefficiencies or even degrade quality in contexts where concise, heuristic-driven reasoning is more appropriate. In particular, tasks requiring commonsense or intuitive judgments are often better handled by System 1 models, which respond more directly. This highlights a central insight of our study: extended reasoning is not universally beneficial, and reasoning strategies must be evaluated in relation to the task.

### <sup>293</sup> 5.3 Moving from Fast to Slow Thinking

<sup>294</sup> In the previous analysis, System 1 and System 2 models can be viewed as endpoints of a broader <sup>295</sup> spectrum of reasoning strategies. Paralleling approaches in cognitive psychology [\(Daw et al., 2011;](#page-9-7)

![](_page_7_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 3: Accuracy across benchmark categories as reasoning shifts from System 1 to System 2.

[Piray and Daw, 2021\)](#page-12-2), we explored this spectrum by constructing interpolated models—blending System 1 and System 2 preferred answers at varying ratios in the alignment dataset. Figure [3](#page-7-0) demonstrates a consistent, monotonic transition in accuracy across representative benchmarks from three reasoning categories (all r <sup>2</sup> > 0.9, p < 0.001), a pattern visible across all benchmarks (see Appendix [M\)](#page-17-2). While arithmetic and symbolic reasoning benchmarks exhibit a steady increase in accuracy moving toward System 2 thinking, commonsense reasoning benchmarks show the opposite trend, with accuracy increasing as models rely more on System 1 reasoning. This trade-off highlights that both reasoning styles offer unique advantages, with System 2 excelling in structured, multi-step problem-solving and System 1 providing efficient, adaptable responses in intuitive scenarios. These findings strengthen the importance of task-dependent reasoning strategies that leverage the strengths of both System 1 and System 2 thinking. Critically, there are no sudden drops or fluctuations in performance when transitioning between reasoning styles. This stability indicates that the shift from System 1 to System 2 reasoning is gradual and predictable, without any unexpected anomalies. This observation reinforces the idea that LLMs can be strategically guided toward different reasoning styles, allowing for more adaptive problem-solving.

#### 5.4 Reasoning & Uncertainty

 A key insight from psychology and neuroscience is that System 1 operates on confident heuristics, providing quick, intuitive judgments, while System 2 engages in more deliberate, analytical thought, accurately assessing the uncertainty associated with its conclusions [\(Daw et al., 2005;](#page-9-4) [Lee et al.,](#page-11-16) [2014;](#page-11-16) [Keramati et al., 2011;](#page-11-2) [Xu, 2021\)](#page-13-13). To examine uncertainty and confidence, we consider three different characteristics: 1) token-level uncertainty; 2) the presence of hedge words in model output [\(Lakoff, 1973;](#page-11-17) [Ott, 2018\)](#page-11-18); and 3) definitive commitment to responses in System 1 versus System 2.

 Plot A in Figure [4](#page-8-0) shows that System 2 models consistently generate tokens with lower confi- dence than System 1 models, based on token-level uncertainty from logits. This trend holds across arithmetic t(4075) = 54.53, p < .001, symbolic t(999) = 42.53, p < .001, and commonsense t(3510) = 106.86, p < .001 benchmarks. Additionally, we analyzed surface-level uncertainty in model reasoning by examining word choices. Figure [4,](#page-8-0) Plot B shows System 2-aligned models use significantly more hedge words, in arithmetic t(4075) = 22.03, p < .001 and commonsense t(3510) = 21.49, p < .001 when models reiterate their reasoning. While increased uncertainty enhances analytical reasoning, it may hinder tasks requiring rapid, intuitive judgments. To assess early-stage response conclusiveness, we used LLM-as-Judge [\(Zheng et al., 2023\)](#page-13-14) as detailed in Appendix [N.](#page-17-3) Figure [4,](#page-8-0) Plot C shows System 1 models provide significantly more definitive responses than System 2 models in commonsense reasoning, *McNemar's* χ (1, 400) = 20.0, p < .001, regardless of where in the response the definitive responses is reached (see Appendix [N\)](#page-17-3).

 This analysis reinforces the idea that different reasoning styles are suited to different tasks. Greater uncertainty in models' generated reasoning suggests that System 2 models can explore alternative reasoning paths more effectively. This uncertainty is reflected in both their model output probabilities and word choices. System 2 models' superior performance in arithmetic benchmarks highlights the benefits of deliberate, effortful processing in tasks that demand exploration and uncertainty. On the other hand, the greater tendency of System 1 models to commit to responses in a more definitive way aligns with their advantage in tasks requiring rapid and intuitive judgments. This behavior is observed exclusively in commonsense reasoning, where quick, decisive responses are advantageous—a trend supported by human studies [\(Byrd, 2022\)](#page-9-16) and confirmed by our findings in Section [5.1.](#page-5-1) However, it does not appear in other benchmarks (see Appendix [N\)](#page-17-3), suggesting that the activation of a particular reasoning style is context-dependent and influenced by task demands.

#### 6 Conclusion

 A central question in current LLM development is whether structured, step-by-step reasoning is always beneficial, or whether a more flexible range of reasoning strategies is needed. Inspired by dual-process theories of human cognition, we studied LLMs explicitly aligned with System 1 and System 2 thinking, representing fast, heuristic reasoning and slow, analytical reasoning, respectively. Our findings indicate that, much like in human cognition, reasoning in LLMs is not a one-size-fits- all solution: different reasoning modes are effective in different contexts and downstream tasks. System 2 excels in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1 is more effective and accurate in commonsense reasoning (Section [5.1\)](#page-5-1). Training intermediate models with blended ratios of preferred System 1 and System 2 responses revealed smooth, monotonic shifts in performance across benchmarks (Section [5.3\)](#page-6-2), supporting the view that LLM reasoning lies on a continuous, tunable spectrum rather than a binary divide. Additionally, System 1 models generate responses with fewer tokens, highlighting its efficiency in decision-making (Section [5.2\)](#page-6-3). Finally, our analysis in Section [5.4](#page-7-1) illustrated that System 2 models exhibit greater uncertainty throughout the reasoning process, potentially enabling them to engage in more structured, step-by-step problem-solving. In contrast, System 1 models display higher confidence, allowing them to reach responses faster, which is particularly advantageous for tasks requiring rapid, intuitive judgments.

 Beyond these empirical findings, our study aligns with broader principles observed across cognitive science and neuroscience. The observation that System 1 models generate faster responses echoes established theories in human cognition, where intuitive, heuristic-driven thinking allows for rapid decision-making. Similarly, the higher uncertainty exhibited by System 2 models aligns with neuroscience findings that deliberate reasoning involves increased cognitive load and self-monitoring mechanisms. These parallels suggest that LLMs, when properly aligned, can mirror key aspects of human cognition, offering new insights into both artificial and natural intelligence.

 Our work bridges between LLM development and cognitive science, highlighting how we can enable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs in LLMs, similar to those long observed in human cognition. We align models with reasoning behaviors that follow well-known cognitive heuristics, which humans use in everyday thinking, like System 1's rapid, intuitive judgments and System 2's deliberate, analytical thought, and show they can follow the dynamic interplay between fast and slow thinking. This alignment not only informs more sophisticated training and evaluation strategies but also suggests that future LLMs can be designed to possess a more cognitively grounded flexibility, allowing them to adapt their reasoning as effectively as humans do when faced with diverse task demands. Finally, models that reason in ways that are cognitively interpretable, mirroring the human brain's strategies for learning, decision making, and inference, may also be more predictable, steerable, and trustworthy in deployment. In this light, dual-process alignment connects cognitive science and neuroscience with model capabilities, enabling future LLMs to reason more like humans, not just in what they conclude, but in how they get there.

 This paper is a first step toward adaptive reasoning in LLMs, where models can dynamically shift between heuristic and deliberative thinking based on task demands. Furthermore, understanding how to optimally balance speed and accuracy in LLMs can have significant implications for real-world applications, from conversational agents to automated decision-making systems. In practice, this approach could let us deliberately trade off answer quality for faster responses by choosing fewer reasoning steps when time is critical.

### A Limitations

 Despite the promising advancements of using different thinking styles through the lens of dual-process cognitive theory in our approach, it is important to clarify the intended scope and outline future directions. Our curated dataset of 2,000 questions covers 10 well-established cognitive heuristics and was validated by our domain experts to ensure quality. While not exhaustive, this dataset provides a strong foundation for investigating reasoning style differences and establishes methodological groundwork for broader-scale expansion in future studies to represent the entire spectrum of reasoning challenges encountered in real-world tasks. We focused our alignment experiments on Llama and Mistral as base models, using DPO and SIMPO as preference optimization techniques. While our findings are likely to generalize across model architectures and alignment methods, given the shared emergence of both intuitive and deliberative reasoning in large-scale pretraining, testing this generalization to other architectures and alignment methods is a valuable future direction. In terms of evaluating reasoning uncertainty, we adopt token-level logit-based measures and linguistic hedging analysis as computationally tractable proxies. These provide interpretable signals of reasoning behavior, though deeper psycholinguistic and interactive evaluations may offer complementary insights. Finally, while our experiments reveal a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off between intuitive and deliberative reasoning, the extent to which these findings translate to more complex or dynamic decision-making scenarios remains an open question. Future work should explore larger, more diverse datasets and investigate alternative alignment strategies to further validate and extend these results.

# B Ethical Statement

 Aligning LLMs with System 1 and System 2 reasoning raises concerns about model behavior in different contexts. System 1 models may produce overly confident but incorrect responses, while System 2 models, though more deliberate, may slow response times and increase computational costs. Responsible deployment requires balancing these trade-offs to prevent biased or misleading outputs.

# C Cognitive heuristics

 In Table [3,](#page-14-2) we list 10 different cognitive heuristics and their definitions, which we used in curating the dataset [Kahneman](#page-11-1) [\(2011\)](#page-11-1); [Stanovich and West](#page-12-0) [\(2000\)](#page-12-0); [Evans and Stanovich](#page-10-2) [\(2013\)](#page-10-2).

| Recency Bias                | The tendency to better remember and recall information presented to us most recently, compared to information we            |
|                             | encountered earlier                                                                                                         |

| Planning Fallacy            | The tendency to underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task, as well as the costs and risks associated |
|                             | with that task even if it contradicts our experiences.                                                                      |
| Bandwagon Effect Bias       | The tendency to adopt beliefs or behaviors because many others do.                                                          |

# <sup>654</sup> F Prompt for Data Expansion

<sup>655</sup> We expand our sample dataset by concatenating the expert-generated samples with the definitions in <sup>656</sup> Table [3,](#page-14-2) along with a description of how System 1 and System 2 would respond to a given question, <sup>657</sup> as shown below:

The System 1 response should be intuitive, fast, and reflect the cognitive heuristic associated with the question.

658

The System 2 response should be more deliberate, slower, and use reasoning to correct or mitigate the heuristic.

### <sup>660</sup> G Topic Modeling

 Following expert validation, we experimentally verified the diversity of our dataset to ensure it goes beyond surface-level variation in wording. Figure [5](#page-16-3) presents the results of topic modeling using BERTopic [\(Grootendorst, 2022\)](#page-10-13), demonstrating the range of topics covered in the dataset. The wide distribution and clustering across 150 unique topics demonstrate the semantic diversity of the dataset beyond superficial lexical variation.

# H Benchmark Details

 We use three categories of reasoning benchmarks: arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, symbolic reasoning, We provide an overview of the datasets used in each category.

 Arithmetic reasoning. We use six datasets: MultiArith, GSM8K, AddSub, AQuA, SingleEq, and SVAMP. Each dataset consists of questions that present a scenario requiring numerical computation and multi-step reasoning based on mathematical principles.

 Commonsense reasoning. To assess commonsense reasoning, we utilize five benchmarks: Com- monsenseQA (CSQA), StrategyQA, PIQA, SocialIQA (SIQA), and Com2Sense. All require models to go beyond surface-level understanding and reason using prior knowledge. CSQA focuses on multiple-choice questions grounded in general world knowledge, while StrategyQA includes ques- tions that demand implicit multi-hop reasoning. PIQA evaluates physical commonsense by requiring models to choose the more plausible solution to everyday benchmarks. SIQA targets social common- sense, presenting scenarios about interpersonal interactions and asking questions about motivations, reactions, and emotions. Com2Sense provides pairs of complementary sentences to test a model's ability to distinguish between plausible and implausible statements using commonsense.

 Symbolic reasoning. We use the Last Letter Concatenation and Coin Flip datasets. Last Letter Concatenation involves forming a word by extracting the last letter of given words in order. Coin Flip presents a sequence of coin-flipping instructions and asks for the final coin orientation. These datasets were originally proposed by [Wei et al.](#page-13-15) [\(2023a\)](#page-13-15) but were not publicly available. [Kojima et al.](#page-11-14) [\(2023\)](#page-11-14) later followed their approach to create and release accessible versions, which we use in our experiments.

# I Equivalence Testing of Dataset Lengths Using TOST

 A two one-sided t-test (TOST) confirmed the equivalence of these post-adjustment lengths across various token counts as equivalence margins: ±3 tokens, t(3870.30) = 85.82, p < .001; ±5 tokens, t(3870.30) = 149.07, p < .001; ±7 tokens, t(3870.30) = 212.31, p < .001; and 5% of the mean token count (±4.15 tokens), t(3870.30) = 122.29, p < .001

## J Length Adjustment Threshold and Prompt

 We adjust the length if there is a disparity of more than 15 tokens between the System 1 and System 2 outputs using GPT-4o with the following prompt:

For a given {question}, we have two types of answers: A fast, intuitive response based on cognitive heuristics which is our System 1 Answer. System 1 Answer: {System 1 Answer} And a slow, deliberate, and logical reasoning response which is our System 2 Answer. System 2 Answer: {System 2 Answer} Your task is to adjust the two answers so that they are presented in the same order of tokens without altering their content. Ensure that the intuitive nature of the System 1 Answer and the logical reasoning of the System 2 Answer are preserved.

# <sup>698</sup> L Implementation Details

 We use Python 3.10.12, PEFT 0.12.0, PyTorch 2.4.0, and Transformers 4.44.2. The dataset is split [i](#page-10-14)nto 80% training and 20% validation. For alignment, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA [Hu](#page-10-14) [et al., 2021\)](#page-10-14) with a rank of 8, an alpha of 16, and dropout rate of 0.1. We train for five epochs, using accuracy on winner responses as an early stopping criterion to prevent overfitting, with patience of 5. We set the train batch size to 4 and the validation batch size to 8. To align Llama 3 using the DPO method, we followed [Meng et al.](#page-11-10) [\(2024\)](#page-11-10) and set the learning rate to 7e − 7 with beta of 0.01. For SimPO, we use a learning rate of 1e − 6, beta of 2.5, and a gamma-to-beta ratio of 0.55. For Mistral v0.1, we set the DPO learning rate to 5e − 7 with beta of 0.001. In SimPO, we use a learning rate of 5e − 7, beta of 2.5, and a gamma-to-beta ratio of 0.1.

<sup>708</sup> The experiments were conducted using NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU equipped with 48GB of RAM. <sup>709</sup> The total computation time amounted to approximately 800 GPU hours.

# <sup>712</sup> N Additional Insights into Models' Reasoning

 In this analysis, we investigate when different models reach definitive answers. We aim to detect this commitment as early as possible during the reasoning process. This early commitment serves as a proxy for the model's confidence in the generated reasoning and its final answer. By analyzing this behavior, we explore whether models can arrive at a definitive answer or if they leave room for ambiguity or subjective interpretation.

![](_page_18_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 6: Accuracy across different benchmarks as reasoning shifts from System 1 to System 2.

 We leverage the strong extractive capabilities of LLMs [\(Wei et al., 2023b\)](#page-13-16) and their near-human-like annotation abilities [\(Gilardi et al., 2023;](#page-10-15) [Alizadeh et al., 2023\)](#page-9-17). Specifically, we focus on the Phi4 (14B) model [\(Abdin et al., 2024\)](#page-9-18), which demonstrates exceptional performance in question-answering and reasoning benchmarks, even surpassing closed-source models like GPT-4o [\(Hurst et al., 2024\)](#page-10-9). To determine whether a model's reasoning contains a definitive answer, we use the following prompt fed to Phi4:

Does the given answer directly answer the given question in a definitive way? ONLY RETURN YES OR NO IN A \textbf{}. Definitive answers are clear and do not leave room for interpretation or ambiguity. If the answer tries to explore multiple perspectives or factors involved, it is not definitive, and YOU HAVE TO RETURN NO.

 This prompt is applied to reasoning generated by both System 1 and System 2 models. To understand when these models commit to a definitive answer during their reasoning process, we focus on the first n sentences of their reasoning, where n ∈ {1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15}. We set a cap of 15 sentences based on our observations that nearly all generated reasonings across benchmarks fall within this range (see Figure [8\)](#page-19-0).

 Applying the prompt to each generated reasoning from the models across all benchmarks (200 randomly sampled data points from each benchmark, totaling 2000 samples for both System 1 and System 2 reasonings), we append six solved demonstrations to the prompt to help further guide the models. These demonstrations, selected randomly from the cognitive heuristics introduced in Section [3.2,](#page-3-1) help clarify what qualifies as a definitive answer, aligning the models' knowledge with patterns we have aligned System 1 and 2 models with (see Section [3.1\)](#page-3-2).

Figure [7](#page-19-1) shows the proportion of definitive answers in the first n sentences, across all benchmarks.[<sup>2</sup>](#page-18-2) For tasks where quick, intuitive judgments are advantageous, such as in commonsense reasoning. System 1 models consistently provide more definitive answers than System 2 models. This gap emerges early, with System 1 providing more definitive answers in the first three sentences. The difference persists even as we extend the number of sentences considered (see Table [6](#page-19-2) for a quantitative analysis of the significance between System 1 and System 2 regarding the definitiveness of their answers).

### O System-Specific Failure Patterns

 To complement the main results, we include two analyses that illustrate how System 1 and System 2 models diverge in failure patterns depending on task type. In numerical reasoning benchmarks, System 2 models are more reliable when higher precision is required, while in commonsense benchmarks, System 1 models tend to produce more contextually appropriate answers. The following figure and table offer additional insight into these differences.

 To further analyze the behavioral differences between System 1 and System 2 models, we examine their performance on AddSub items with varying numeric complexity. Figure [9](#page-20-0) shows the distribution of digit types in ground truth answers across four outcome categories. Notably, in examples where System 2 succeeds and System 1 fails ("Sys2 better"), the ground truth answers tend to have a

Note that this ratio should not necessarily converge to 1.0 as more sentences are considered. In some cases, even when considering the full reasoning chain, the models may still leave room for vagueness.

Figure 9: Distribution of digit characteristics in AddSub ground truth (GT) answers across different outcome categories. Left: total number of digits. Right: number of digits after the decimal point. Notably, examples where System 2 is correct and System 1 is not ("Sys2 better") tend to have more floating-point digits, indicating higher numerical precision.

 significantly higher number of floating-point digits (Mann–Whitney U test, U = 346.0, p = 0.0051). This pattern suggests that System 2 is more effective at handling cases requiring greater numerical precision. In contrast, the number of total digits (irrespective of decimal placement) does not differ meaningfully between the "Sys2 better" and "Sys1 better" subsets (U = 224.0, p = 0.99).

 We also provide a qualitative comparison of commonsense failures made by System 2, shown in [Table 7.](#page-21-0) The table includes representative examples from CSQA where System 2 responses, although logically coherent, miss intuitive or socially grounded answers. These cases highlight how interpretive depth can lead to answers that diverge from typical human judgment.

### <sup>766</sup> NeurIPS Paper Checklist

<sup>767</sup> [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .

#### <sup>768</sup> 1. Claims

<sup>769</sup> Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the <sup>770</sup> paper's contributions and scope?

<sup>771</sup> Answer: [Yes]

<sup>772</sup> Justification: The claims made in the abstract and introduction of the paper match and are <sup>773</sup> backed by the experimental results provided in Section [5.](#page-5-2)

<sup>774</sup> Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

### <sup>784</sup> 2. Limitations

<sup>785</sup> Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

<sup>786</sup> Answer: [Yes]

 • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor- tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

#### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

 Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

 Justification: Our paper is primarily empirical and does not present formal theoretical results or proofs.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross- referenced. • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

 Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex- perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: All experimental configurations, data, and code are publicly available in our repository.

 • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis- sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

### 5. Open access to data and code

 Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc- tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: We have open-sourced our code as well as the accompanying dataset that is introduced in the paper.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) [public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https:](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) [//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).

 • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

#### 6. Experimental setting/details

 Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper- parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: All experimental settings and details are provided in Section [4.3](#page-5-3) and Ap-pendix [L.](#page-17-1)

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

### 7. Experiment statistical significance

 Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: We used suitable statistical analysis based on the variable in different part of our paper such as Section [3.2,](#page-3-1) Section [5.3,](#page-6-2) Section [5.2,](#page-6-3) and Section [5.4.](#page-7-1)

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi- dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

### 8. Experiments compute resources

 Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com- puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Appendix [L,](#page-17-1) we have provided the computation resources.

 • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

#### 9. Code of ethics

 Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics <https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines>?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: We have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and made sure that the paper conforms to it.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

#### 10. Broader impacts

 Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: We provide high-level, abstract interpretations of our results and discuss their broader implications, including potential societal impacts, in both Section [5](#page-5-2) and Section [6.](#page-8-1) These include the risks of over-relying on a single mode of reasoning in LLMs and the importance of aligning model behavior with context-sensitive cognitive strategies.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

### 11. Safeguards

 Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

 Justification: This paper contributes to the field of reasoning in language models, which is neutral with respect to misuse or dual-use concerns. It does not involve the release of high-risk models or datasets and does not pose foreseeable risks requiring specific safeguards.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

#### 12. Licenses for existing assets

 Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We used Apache-2.0 as our license in github.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, <paperswithcode.com/datasets> has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

### 13. New assets

 Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our code and data are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

#### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

 Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] .

Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu- tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

#### 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

 Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA] .

Justification: Our paper did not involve crowdsourcing and human subjects.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. • Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. • We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. • For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

#### 16. Declaration of LLM usage

 Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [NA] .

 Justification: The core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.

Guidelines:

 • The answer NA means that our core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components. • Please refer to our LLM policy (<https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM>) for what should or should not be described.
