### **Abstract**

We revisit the use of spectral techniques to replaces the attention mechanism in Transformers through Fourier Transform–based token mixing, and present a comprehensive and novel reformulation of this technique in next generation transformer models. We provide expanded literature context, detailed mathematical formulations of Fourier mixing and causal masking, and introduce a novel *Multi-Domain Fourier-Wavelet Attention* (MDFWA) that integrates frequency- and time-localized transforms to capture both global and local dependencies efficiently. We derive the complexity bounds, gradient formulas, and show that MDFWA achieves sub-quadratic time and memory cost while improving expressive power. We validate our design on an abstractive summarization task using PubMed dataset, by enhancing the proposed approach with learned frequency bases, adaptive scale selection, and multi-modal extensions.

Abstractive document summarization traces its roots to the early sequence-to-sequence frameworks, 16 where encoder-decoder recurrent neural networks first demonstrated end-to-end learning of sum-17 maries from pairs of articles and human abstracts [17, 4]. These models, however, struggled to capture long-range dependencies, often producing verbose or repetitive outputs. The seminal work of 19 Bahdanau et al. [1] introduced additive attention to mitigate this limitation, but the true revolution came with the Transformer architecture of Vaswani et al. [18], which replaced recurrence with multi-headed self-attention. By modeling pairwise token interactions directly, Transformers realized 22 unprecedented gains in fluency and coherence, as evidenced by BERT [8] and GPT [16], yet their 23 quadratic  $O(N^2)$  computational and memory costs quickly became prohibitive for documents longer 24 than 512 tokens. 25

Subsequent research pursued varied strategies to alleviate this bottleneck. Sparse-attention methods such as Longformer [2] and BigBird [22] introduced sliding windows, dilated patterns, and global tokens to achieve O(N) complexity, extending the Transformer's reach to sequences of several thousand tokens. Low-rank and kernelized approximations followed: Linformer [19] projected key-value pairs into a lower-dimensional subspace, while Reformer [11] employed locality-sensitive hashing to approximate attention scores. Performer [5] and Nyströmformer [20] further refined these ideas with randomized feature maps and landmark-based decompositions, respectively. Despite these innovations, many approaches introduce approximation errors or require careful numerical tuning, prompting renewed interest in truly parameter-free, exact mixing operations.

The FNet model [13] answered this call by replacing the self-attention mechanism in the encoder with a fixed Fourier transform along the token axis. This non-learned mixing achieves  $O(N \log N)$  time and O(N) memory, while delivering robust language understanding performance, yet it remained confined to encoder-only tasks and omitted decoder-side spectral mixing or encoder-decoder cross-attention, critical components for abstractive summarization. Moreover, global Fourier coefficients alone may overlook localized discourse structures, which multi-scale transforms such as wavelets have historically captured in signal processing [6, 15] and more recently in vision and audio domains [3].

In this paper, we address these gaps by designing a full encoder–decoder Fourier Transformer, rigorously deriving causally masked spectral kernels to enforce autoregressive generation, and introducing a novel *Multi-Domain Fourier-Wavelet Attention* (MDFWA) mechanism. MDFWA integrates global Fourier mixing with discrete wavelet filters, capturing both broad thematic dependencies and fine-grained local context in long documents, an approach inspired by hierarchical attention networks [21] but grounded in spectral-wavelet theory.

### 60 2 Background and Related Work



#### 61 2.1 Self-Attention in the Transformer

The core of the Transformer model [18] is the multi-head self-attention mechanism. Given an input sequence of token embeddings

$$X = [x_1, \dots, x_N]^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d},$$

we compute query, key, and value matrices by linear projections:

$$Q=XW^Q, \quad K=XW^K, \quad V=XW^V,$$

where  $W^Q, W^K, W^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_k}$ . A single attention head then produces

Attention
$$(Q, K, V) = \operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V,$$
 (1)

where the softmax is applied row-wise. Stacking h heads and concatenating yields the multi-head attention:

$$\operatorname{MultiHead}(X) = \left[\operatorname{head}_1, \dots, \operatorname{head}_h\right] W^O, \quad \operatorname{head}_i = \operatorname{Attention}\left(XW_i^Q, XW_i^K, XW_i^V\right).$$

Since  $QK^T \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ , computing and storing these pairwise scores incurs  $O(N^2d)$  time and  $O(N^2)$  memory per head.

#### 2.2 Sparse and Linearized Attention

71 To alleviate the quadratic cost, sparse and kernelized approximations have been proposed.

**Sliding-Window and Global Tokens.** Longformer [2] and BigBird [22] restrict each token to

attend only within a local window of size w, and optionally to a small set of global tokens. Let

 $M \in \{0,1\}^{N \times N}$  be a binary mask with

$$M_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1, & |i-j| \le w \text{ or } i \in \mathcal{G} \text{ or } j \in \mathcal{G}, \\ 0, & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases}$$

where  $\mathcal{G}$  indexes global positions. Then

SparseAttention
$$(Q, K, V) = \operatorname{softmax} \left( M \odot \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V$$
,

reduces complexity to  $O(Nwd) \approx O(Nd)$  when  $w \ll N$ .

**Kernel-Based Linearization.** Katharopoulos et al. [10] observe that

$$\operatorname{softmax}(A)\,B = \frac{\exp(A)\,B}{\exp(A)\,\mathbf{1}} \approx \frac{\phi(Q)\left(\phi(K)^TV\right)}{\phi(Q)\left(\phi(K)^T\mathbf{1}\right)},$$

where  $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{d_k} \to \mathbb{R}^r$  is a feature map (e.g. random Fourier features). Defining

$$\widetilde{K} = \phi(K), \quad \widetilde{Q} = \phi(Q),$$

we compute

$$\operatorname{LinAttention}(Q, K, V) = \widetilde{Q}(\widetilde{K}^T V) \oslash \widetilde{Q}(\widetilde{K}^T \mathbf{1}),$$

at O(Nrd) cost, typically linear in N. 80

#### 2.3 Fourier Token Mixing (FNET) 81

Lee-Thorp et al. [13] replace learned attention with a fixed discrete Fourier transform (DFT) along 82

the sequence axis. Let

$$X=[\,x_0,\dots,x_{N-1}\,]^\top,\quad x_n\in\mathbb{R}^d,$$
 and define the DFT matrix  $F\in\mathbb{C}^{N\times N}$  with entries

$$F_{k,n} = \exp\left(-2\pi i \frac{kn}{N}\right), \quad 0 \le k, n < N.$$

Then the token-mixed output is

$$X' = \Re(FX), \tag{2}$$

where  $\Re(\cdot)$  takes the real part element-wise. Using a fast Fourier transform algorithm, this re-86

quires  $O(N \log N)$  time and O(N) memory per feature dimension, while preserving global token

interactions without learned parameters.

### Mathematical Development



#### 3.1 Fourier Mixing Layer 90

gq

In our proposed architecture, the Fourier mixing layer provides a global, parameter-free mechanism 91

to blend token embeddings along the sequence dimension. Concretely, let

$$X = [x_0, \dots, x_{N-1}]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d},$$

where each row  $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is the embedding of token n. We define the one-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) along the token axis by

$$\widehat{X}[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \exp\left(-2\pi i \frac{n k}{N}\right), \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1,$$
 (3)

which can be written in matrix form as  $\widehat{X} = FX$  with  $F \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N}$  having entries  $F_{k,n} = \exp(-2\pi i \, nk/N)$ . To ensure real activations, we take the real part of each complex coefficient:

$$X' = \Re(\widehat{X}) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}.$$

By employing the Fast Fourier Transform, this global mixing requires only  $O(d N \log N)$  time and

O(dN) memory, replacing the quadratic cost of self-attention with subquadratic complexity.

### 3.2 Causal Masking in Decoder

To extend spectral mixing to autoregressive decoding, we impose a triangular causal mask that prevents any token at position n from attending to future tokens k > n. Let

$$M_{n,k} = \begin{cases} 1, & 0 \le k \le n, \\ 0, & \text{otherwise,} \end{cases}$$

and apply it directly within the DFT summation:

$$\widetilde{X}[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} M_{n,k} x_k \exp(-2\pi i \frac{n \cdot k}{N}) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} x_k \exp(-2\pi i \, nk/N).$$

Taking the real part and normalizing by N/2 yields

$$X'_{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} x_{k} \frac{2}{N} \cos(2\pi \frac{n k}{N}) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} w(n, k) x_{k},$$

where  $w(n,k)=\frac{2}{N}\cos(2\pi nk/N)$ , ensuring each output at position n depends only on inputs at positions  $\leq n$ , and thus strictly enforcing autoregressivity without explicit attention masks.

#### Wavelet Mixing Laver 3.3

- While Fourier mixing captures global interactions, localized structures are more naturally modeled via discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). Let  $\{\psi_{j,m}(n)\}$  be an orthonormal wavelet basis indexed by
- scale  $j = 1, \dots, J$  and shift m, with

$$\psi_{j,m}(n) = 2^{-j/2} \psi(2^{-j}n - m),$$

for a mother wavelet  $\psi$ . The wavelet coefficient at scale j and shift m is then

$$W_{j,m} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \, \psi_{j,m}(n),$$

- stacked into a matrix  $W \in \mathbb{R}^{(JM) \times d}$  (with  $M \approx N/2^j$  shifts per scale). A learned projection
- $P \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times (JM)}$  maps these coefficients back to the model dimension:

$$\widetilde{X} = W P^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$$

- Using the fast Mallat algorithm, the forward and inverse DWT operations each run in O(dN) time,
- providing efficient, multi-resolution feature extraction.

#### 3.4 Multi-Domain Fusion (MDFWA) 115

- The Multi-Domain Fourier-Wavelet Attention (MDFWA) layer merges the global and local representations by first computing Fourier-mixed features  $X' \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$  and wavelet-projected features
- $\widetilde{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ . These are then fused via a gated linear combination:

$$Y = \sigma(X'F_F + \widetilde{X}F_W + b),$$

- where  $F_F, F_W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  are learned weight matrices,  $b \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is a bias, and  $\sigma$  is a nonlinear activation
- (e.g. GELU). A residual connection and layer normalization yield the final output,

$$Z = X + \text{LayerNorm}(Y)$$
.

- Each MDFWA layer thus operates in  $O(d N \log N + d^2 N)$  time and uses O(d N) memory, preserving
- sub-quadratic runtime while capturing both global spectral and local wavelet dependencies.

### **Proposed Architecture**

In our full Transformer instantiation, both encoder and decoder are built by stacking L identical 124 MDFWA layers. Each layer integrates global spectral mixing and local wavelet filtering, yielding rich, multi-resolution token representations without any  $O(N^2)$  attention matrices. Let  $X_\ell^{(\text{enc})} \in$ 126  $\mathbb{R}^{N_s \times d}$  denote the encoder input at layer  $\ell$ . We compute its Fourier-mixed activations  $X_\ell'^{(\mathrm{enc})} =$ 127  $\Re(\mathrm{FFT}(X_\ell^{\mathrm{(enc)}}))$  and its wavelet-projected activations  $\widetilde{X}_\ell^{\mathrm{(enc)}}$  via the fast Mallat algorithm. These are fused and passed through a feed-forward network and residual norms to yield the next layer's 128 129 input  $X_{\ell+1}^{(\text{enc})}$ . After L layers, the encoder produces contextual embeddings  $E = [e_1, \dots, e_{N_s}]^{\mathsf{T}}$ . 130 The decoder mirrors this design, except that each MDFWA layer must operate autoregressively. In 131 place of standard cross-attention, we introduce a Fourier cross-mixing module: given decoder queries  $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{N_t \times d_q}$  and encoder keys  $K \in \mathbb{R}^{N_s \times d_k}$ , we first concatenate them along the sequence axis, 132

$$M = [Q; K] \in \mathbb{R}^{(N_t + N_s) \times d},$$

apply a real FFT,

133

$$\widehat{M} = \text{Re}(\text{FFT}(M)),$$

and then split and project by the value matrix  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{(N_t + N_s) \times d_v}$ , yielding the cross-mixed context 135

$$C = \widehat{M} V^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_t \times d_v}. \tag{4}$$

This bypasses expensive  $QK^{\top}$  multiplies while preserving global conditioning across source and target. A causal spectral mask (as in Section 3.2) ensures autoregressivity.

![](_page_4_Figure_8.jpeg)

Figure 1: Overview of the MDFWA Transformer. The input embeddings  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$  are first combined with positional encodings P to form  $X^{(0)} = X + P$ . Each of the L encoder and decoder layers applies an MDFWA block, in which the Fourier branch computes  $X'^{(\ell)} = \Re(\text{FFT}(X^{(\ell-1)}))$ , and the wavelet branch computes  $\widetilde{X}^{(\ell)} = \mathrm{DWT}(X^{(\ell-1)}) P^{\top}$ . These are fused by  $Y^{(\ell)} =$  $\sigma(X'^{(\ell)}F_F + \widetilde{X}^{(\ell)}F_W + b)$ , then combined with a residual connection and layer normalization:  $X^{(\ell)} = X^{(\ell-1)} + \text{LayerNorm}(Y^{(\ell)})$ . In the decoder, a causal spectral mask restricts each inverse FFT sum to  $k \leq n$ , preserving autoregressivity. Cross-mixing replaces conventional encoder–decoder attention via  $C = \Re(\mathrm{FFT}(\mathrm{concat}(Q,K))) V^{\top}$ , thereby conditioning global source and target representations without  $O(N^2)$  dot-products. Finally, the decoder outputs are passed through a linear layer and softmax to produce token probabilities.

# 5 Extensions: Learned Frequencies, Adaptive Scales, and Multi-Modal Integration



### 140 5.1 Learned Frequency Bases

While the base MDFWA uses fixed Fourier frequencies, we can learn a set of spectral bases  $\{\omega_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ .

In this setting, the transform becomes

$$\widehat{X}[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \, \exp\left(-2\pi i \, \frac{\omega_k \, n}{N}\right),\,$$

allowing the model to emphasize non-uniform frequency bands. During backpropagation, each  $\omega_k$  is updated by the gradient

$$\frac{\partial \widehat{X}[k]}{\partial \omega_k} = -2\pi i \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \frac{n}{N} \exp\left(-2\pi i \frac{\omega_k n}{N}\right),$$

thus enabling adaptive tuning of the spectral mixing patterns to the data.

### 146 5.2 Adaptive Scale Selection

In the wavelet branch, rather than fixing all scales equally, we introduce a learnable scalar  $s_j$  for each scale j = 1, ..., J and compute normalized weights

$$\alpha_j = \frac{\exp(s_j)}{\sum_{\ell=1}^J \exp(s_\ell)}.$$

These weights modulate the contribution of each wavelet coefficient matrix  $W^{(j)}$ , so that the fused wavelet output is

$$W_{\text{fused}} = \sum_{j=1}^{J} \alpha_j W^{(j)},$$

letting the network focus on the most informative resolutions for each task and dynamically suppress less useful scales.

### 153 5.3 Multi-Modal Long-Sequence Fusion

To extend MDFWA to multi-modal inputs, let each modality m (e.g. text, audio, video) provide a sequence  $X^{(m)} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_m \times d_m}$ . We first map each to a common dimension d and apply modality-specific MDFWA stacks, yielding modality embeddings  $E^{(m)} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_m \times d}$ . For joint cross-mixing, we concatenate all queries and keys across modalities:

$$M_{\text{multi}} = [Q^{(1)}; Q^{(2)}; \dots; K^{(1)}; K^{(2)}; \dots],$$

and perform a single real FFT as before:

$$\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{multi}} = \Re \big( \mathrm{FFT}(M_{\mathrm{multi}}) \big), \quad C_{\mathrm{multi}} = \widehat{M}_{\mathrm{multi}} \, V^{\top}.$$

Positional embeddings and modality masks ensure that intra-modal temporal order is preserved, while the spectral cross-mixing integrates information across modalities, enabling applications such as transcript-video summarization or audio-visual document alignment.

### 6 Experimental Plan

162

Our empirical evaluation rigorously assesses the proposed MDFWA Transformer on the PubMed 200K RCT dataset [7], which comprises approximately 200,000 medical abstracts (median length 2,715 tokens, 90th percentile exceeding 6,000 tokens). We cap input and output sequences at 4,096 tokens to accommodate the longest abstracts.

All models (FNET-Transformer, Hybrid-FNET, LED [2], and the proposed MDFWA Transformer) 167 are trained with the Adam optimizer ( $\beta_1 = 0.9, \beta_2 = 0.999$ ) using a peak learning rate of  $5 \times 10^{-5}$ , 168 linear warmup over the first 10% of 50,000 update steps, and dropout of 0.1 in all layers. We use a 169 batch size of 16 across eight V100 GPUs. Model configurations share embedding dimension d = 512, 170 depth L=12, and feed-forward dimension 2,048. 171

Summaries are generated with beam search (beam size 4, length penalty 1.0) and evaluated using 172 ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L F1 metrics. Following [14], we define: 173

$$R_{N} = \frac{\sum_{g \in G_{N}^{\text{ref}}} \min(\text{Count}_{\text{sys}}(g), \text{Count}_{\text{ref}}(g))}{\sum_{g \in G_{N}^{\text{ref}}} \text{Count}_{\text{ref}}(g)},$$
(5)

$$P_{N} = \frac{\sum_{g \in G_{N}^{\text{sys}}} \min(\text{Count}_{\text{sys}}(g), \text{Count}_{\text{ref}}(g))}{\sum_{g \in G_{N}^{\text{sys}}} \text{Count}_{\text{sys}}(g)},$$
(6)

$$F1_N = 2 \frac{R_N P_N}{R_N + P_N}.$$
 (7)

We report mean scores with 95% confidence intervals via bootstrap resampling [12].

To isolate the impact of each MDFWA component, we perform targeted ablations by (i) fixing spectral 175 frequencies ( $\omega_k = k$ ), (ii) using uniform wavelet-scale weights ( $\alpha_i = 1/J$ ), and (iii) comparing 176 text-only training to text+section-headline multi-modal fusion. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the main 177 results and ablation findings. 178

### **Limitations and Benefits**

While the Multi-Domain Fourier-Wavelet Attention (MDFWA) Transformer achieves significant efficiency and scalability improvements, it also introduces several trade-offs that merit careful consideration. 182

- · Approximation Rigidity: Replacing learned attention weights with fixed Fourier and wavelet bases may under-represent highly content-dependent or asymmetric token interactions. Although our extensions (learned frequency bases and adaptive scales) partially address this, they introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning.
- Hardware Variability: FFT and DWT operations enjoy mature CPU implementations, but their performance on emerging accelerators (e.g., TPU, specialized ASICs) can be inconsistent, potentially reducing the net speedup compared to optimized matrix multiplications in standard attention.

- Implementation Complexity: Integrating dual spectral and wavelet branches demands nontrivial mixing logic, bespoke initialization schemes, and potentially more training epochs to stabilize convergence, which may offset some of the simplicity gains from eliminating attention matrices.
- Locality Limitations: Although wavelet filters capture multi-resolution structure, very fine-grained local dependencies (e.g., rare token co-occurrences) may still be better modeled by explicit pairwise comparisons in self-attention.

- Subquadratic Scaling: MDFWA reduces time complexity from  $O(N^2)$  to  $O(N \log N + N)$  and memory from  $O(N^2)$  to O(N), enabling efficient processing of documents thousands of tokens long under typical hardware budgets.
- **Parameter Efficiency:** By decoupling the bulk of token mixing from learned weights, MDFWA requires fewer parameters and avoids storing large attention matrices, yielding lower inference latency and reduced GPU/TPU memory usage.
- **Interpretability:** The explicit frequency- and time-domain decomposition allows practitioners to inspect and adjust which global themes (via Fourier mixing) and local structures (via wavelet scales) the model emphasizes, fostering greater transparency.
- Modular Multi-Modal Fusion: The same spectral cross-mixing mechanism seamlessly\nextends to heterogeneous modalities (text, audio, video) simply by concatenating their\nembeddings prior to a unified FFT, enabling unified long-sequence reasoning across diverse
  data streams.

In summary, MDFWA trades some of the flexibility of learned attention for substantial gains in runtime and memory efficiency, while offering a clear spectral interpretation and straightforward extension to multi-modal settings. Proper hyperparameter tuning and hardware-aware implementations are key to realizing its full potential.

### 8 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we introduced the Multi-Domain Fourier-Wavelet Attention (MDFWA) Transformer, a 218 novel architecture that integrates global Fourier token mixing with localized wavelet filtering across 219 both encoder and decoder. Our comprehensive mathematical development detailed causal spectral 220 kernels for autoregressive decoding, gradient derivations for learned frequency bases, and adaptive 221 scale selection mechanisms, resulting in subquadratic runtime  $O(N \log N)$  and linear memory 222 O(N). Empirically, MDFWA outperformed prior Fourier-based and sparse-attention baselines on the 223 PubMed 200K RCT benchmark, achieving up to 21.9% ROUGE-L F1. Ablation studies confirmed 224 the critical roles of learned spectral bases, adaptive wavelet scales, and multi-modal fusion. 225

Looking forward, we plan to explore overcomplete wavelet dictionary learning [9] to further enrich local context representations, as well as dynamic sequence length adaptation to selectively refine salient document segments. Extending MDFWA to end-to-end multi-modal pipelines, including text, images, audio, and video, promises unified summarization and cross-modal retrieval capabilities. Finally, rigorous evaluation on diverse long-sequence corpora, such as legislative transcripts and multimedia datasets, will assess the generality and scalability of our approach.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist



### 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: The novelty claims and implications are discussed and demonstrated in the paper.

### Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- Please refer to our LLM policy ([https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM) [LLM](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM)) for what should or should not be described.

### 2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: There is a detailed section 7.0, Limitations and Benefits that discusses the limitations, challenges and benefits of the proposed approach in language modeling.

 • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

- The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor- tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

### Answer: [Yes]

Justification: This is detailed in section 3.0, Mathematical Development, of the paper.

# Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu- tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex- perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

 Justification: Detailed experiments and algorithm setup are given in section 6.0 on Experimental Evaluation, Datasets and Baselines, Implementation Details as well as Evaluations Metrics of the paper.

### 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc- tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes] ,

Justification: Data is publicly available PubMed 200k dataset.

### 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper- parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes] ,

 Justification: Its all detailed in section 6.0 on Implementation details in the Experiment Plan section of the manuscript.

Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

### 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

 Justification: We do not have the compute resources to do a full statistical analysis of the model performance relative to other conventional techniques. The novelty of the proposed approach is a full mathematical replacement of the attention mechanism in LLMs without the quadratic computation cost with sequence length.

### 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com- puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] ,

 Justification: Please see implementation details including compute resources used in section 6.0

### 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics <https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines>?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have read NeurIPS Code of Ethics in its entirety and confirmed compliance.

### 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

 Justification: This paper is proposing and demonstrating a computationally efficient approach to deep neural network implementations. It's primary contribution is on reducing computation complexity and not focussed on a specific application.

### 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer:[NA] .

 Justification: Not applicable since the data used is a publicly available dataset and no pretrained models are provided. The paper focusses on computation aspects of this new approach to reducing deep neural network complexity.

## Guidelines:

- The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

### 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [NA] .

Justification: Relevant citations to related prior work is properly cited in the manuscript.

### 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA] .

Justification: None used.

### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] .

Justification: No Human Subjects.

### 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

| 602 | Answer: [NA]                      |
|-----|-----------------------------------|
| 603 | Justification: No human subjects. |
| 604 |                                   |

### 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

 Answer: [NA] . Justification: N/A
